   The best way to use the VM-USB involves building lists of VME
   operations, called \em stacks.  These stacks can either be submitted
   for immediate execution or stored inside the VM-USB for triggered
   execution.  In this way, several events will be autonomously handled
   by the VM-USB with no computer intervention.

   This class allows application programs to painlessly build a stack.
   Stacks are built up by creating an instance of this class, 
   invoking menber functions  to add list elements, and then 
   passing the list to either CVMUSB::loadList or CVMUSB::executeList

   There is nothing sacred about a list with respect to copy construction,
   assignment, or comparison.  Those operations are simply delegated to 
   member data.
